#### Steps to configure your VSCode to attached to a Julia Container

This assumes you have both VSCode and Docker installed. For more information read:

* Installing Docker https://docs.docker.com
* VSCode installation https://code.visualstudio.com/download



1. Once you have both installed. Make sure Docker is up and running. In your terminal, download the Julia image 

```bash
docker pull julia
```



2. Create a container. 

   ```bash
   docker run -name="juliabox" -it julia
   ```

if you want to run the container and mount a volume (shared folder) then run

```bash
docker run --name="juliabox" -it -v <your local path>:/home/ julia
```



Now that we have the container running. Letâ€™s open VSCode. 

3. Click the Extension icon on the left side

4. **Install Remote - Containers **. Which is also a Microsoft official extension. This will allow you to mount into a container. When mounted, it will also attempt to install Vscode server inside the container.

5. With the Docker extension installed. You will see the Docker icon on the left bar. When clicked it should toggle the Docker Explorer. You can see your images, and you can view your running containers (and their status).

With the **Remote-Containers** extension you will see an additional option when you right click on a running container. Click **Attach Visual Studio Coide**. This will open a new window.

It may take few seconds as VSCode will attempt to install and setup the VScode server on your behalf. 



Once connected. Click on the Extensions icon, now you will see a split display between extensions installed locally and extensions installed on Attached Container. If you have the Julia extension installed locally, you will see an option to install it on the attached container. Otherwise, you can just search for it and you will get an option from the install menu.
